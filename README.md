# MarioSFML

C++ program. Comments of the code and names of the variables are entirely written in polish, because the project was marked in one of the subjects at the university. 
It uses SFML library to display graphics and interract with a user.
The project is inspired by the Mario game, but with many changes applied. Exact following original game rules was never a goal of this project.
Used textures do not belong to me. I do not have, nor have I ever had, any financial benefits associated with this project.

Every enemy character has its own internal counter. Depending on their counters, all enemies are performing the actions independently.
Also a player has its own counter. Player is collecting coins to win, after a game (successful or not) player can save the result.
